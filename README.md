# Transit-Map
This map will eventually be a comprehensive outline of every public transit connection in the lower-province, including well-defined urban services, newer rural routes and on-demand zones. I'll slowly be adding more geoJSON/KML documents with route or zonal outlines, to eventually stitch them all together.
